  %small Research Overview
%p A key question in both clinical and basic neuroscience research is how to create synaptic connections to restore function to a damaged or malfunctioning neural circuit. To date, pharmacological treatments and neural implants show promise in generating new synaptic connections; however, neither offers control over where synapses are established. Because a circuitâ€™s function relies on precision within its connectivity, a need exists to generate targeted synaptic connections as a standalone or supplemental strategy for neural circuit repair.
%p Our laboratory focuses on three major topics that all share the long-term goal of informing and generating strategies for neural-circuit repair:
%ol
  %li
    %p Determining how neural circuit function emerges from precise synaptic connectivity.
  %li
    %p Determining the molecular mechanisms that establish connectivity within circuits.
  %li
    %p Designing genetic based tools to rewire or reestablish neural connections in disconnected or miswired neural circuits.
%p We conduct this work in the model organism, <em>Drosophila melanogaster</em>. During development, synapse formation in the central nervous system of this tiny fruit fly utilizes mechanisms conserved in mammalian systems.  Due to this, <em>D. melanogaster</em> has provided tremendous insight on how connections are established and why connections become aberrant in neurodegenerative diseases and neurological disorders.  Most recently, the development of a genetic based neural-engineering tool kit has enabled an unprecedented ability to probe and modify neural circuits within the fruit fly brain.
